Predicting Student Scores Based on Study Hours
This guide demonstrates how to use linear regression to predict a student's score based on the number of study hours.

# Steps
Steps to Predict the Score
# Load the Data:

Download and load the dataset from here("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AdiPersonalWorks/Random/master/student_scores%20-%20student_scores.csv").
# Explore and Prepare the Data:

Examine the dataset to understand its structure.
Ensure that the dataset contains the columns "Hours" and "Scores" and that there are no missing values.
# Fit a Linear Regression Model:

Use the data to create a linear regression model where "Hours" is the independent variable and "Scores" is the dependent variable.
The model will determine the best-fit line that represents the relationship between study hours and scores.
# Make Predictions:

Use the trained model to predict the score for a student who studies for 9.25 hours per day.
# Example Calculation
Based on the sample solution provided in the link, you can apply the following steps:

# Fit the Model:

Using the dataset, you will fit a linear regression model which results in an equation of the form:
Score=Intercept+(Coefficient×Hours)
Score=Intercept+(Coefficient×Hours)
Predict for 9.25 Hours:

Substitute 9.25 into the equation to get the predicted score:
Predicted Score=Intercept+(Coefficient × 9.25)
Predicted Score=Intercept+(Coefficient×9.25)
# Example Output
Following the above steps, the predicted score for a student studying 9.25 hours per day will be approximately 92.82.

# Task 2

# Unsupervised Learning with the Iris Dataset
# Objective
The goal of applying unsupervised learning to the Iris dataset is to uncover inherent patterns or groupings within the data, such as identifying clusters of similar iris flowers based on their features.

# Dataset
The Iris dataset comprises 150 samples of iris flowers with 4 features each:

-> Sepal length
-> Sepal width
-> Petal length
-> Petal width

# Key Steps for Unsupervised Learning

1. Load the Data
Obtain the Iris dataset. This dataset can typically be accessed through various data science libraries or online data repositories.
2. Explore the Data
Understand the Features: Review the dataset to get a sense of the different features available, such as sepal and petal dimensions.
Check Distributions: Look at the distribution of these features to understand their ranges and any potential anomalies.
3. Preprocess the Data
Standardization: To ensure all features contribute equally to the analysis, standardize or normalize the feature values. This step is important for many clustering algorithms as they are sensitive to the scale of the data.
4. Apply Clustering Algorithm

Choose a Clustering Method:

K-Means Clustering: This algorithm partitions the data into a predefined number of clusters by minimizing the variance within each cluster.
DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise): This algorithm groups data based on density, which is useful for identifying clusters of varying shapes and sizes.
Hierarchical Clustering: This method builds a hierarchy of clusters either by iteratively merging or splitting clusters.
Fit the Clustering Model: Apply the chosen clustering algorithm to the dataset. This process will assign each data point to a cluster based on its features.

5. Analyze the Clusters
Visualize Clusters: Use visualizations such as scatter plots to inspect how data points are grouped. Plot features against each other to see the distribution of different clusters.
Examine Cluster Characteristics: Analyze the properties of each cluster to understand what differentiates them. This may involve reviewing the average feature values within each cluster.
6. Interpret the Results
Identify Patterns: Determine if the clusters correspond to known classes or reveal new patterns in the data.
Compare with Known Labels: While unsupervised learning does not use labeled data, you can compare the clusters with the true species labels (if available) to evaluate the clustering quality.
Conclusion
Applying unsupervised learning to the Iris dataset helps in discovering natural groupings or patterns among the iris samples. By exploring clustering techniques, you can identify distinct groups of iris flowers based on their features, providing insights into the underlying structure of the data.
