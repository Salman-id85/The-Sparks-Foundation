Predicting Student Scores Based on Study Hours
This guide demonstrates how to use linear regression to predict a student's score based on the number of study hours.

# Steps
Steps to Predict the Score
# Load the Data:

Download and load the dataset from here("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AdiPersonalWorks/Random/master/student_scores%20-%20student_scores.csv").
# Explore and Prepare the Data:

Examine the dataset to understand its structure.
Ensure that the dataset contains the columns "Hours" and "Scores" and that there are no missing values.
# Fit a Linear Regression Model:

Use the data to create a linear regression model where "Hours" is the independent variable and "Scores" is the dependent variable.
The model will determine the best-fit line that represents the relationship between study hours and scores.
# Make Predictions:

Use the trained model to predict the score for a student who studies for 9.25 hours per day.
# Example Calculation
Based on the sample solution provided in the link, you can apply the following steps:

# Fit the Model:

Using the dataset, you will fit a linear regression model which results in an equation of the form:
Score=Intercept+(Coefficient×Hours)
Score=Intercept+(Coefficient×Hours)
Predict for 9.25 Hours:

Substitute 9.25 into the equation to get the predicted score:
Predicted Score=Intercept+(Coefficient × 9.25)
Predicted Score=Intercept+(Coefficient×9.25)
# Example Output
Following the above steps, the predicted score for a student studying 9.25 hours per day will be approximately 92.82.
